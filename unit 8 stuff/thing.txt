I would like to do the bioscience research program July 20-31 2015. This would help my academic career because I am interested in a career in biotechnology. I really want to do this course because not only would I learn something new about biology and gain some lab experience but I would also be able to experience what college life is like. By this summer I would have completed Honors molecular Biology and next year I have applied for Ap biology. This course would help me get an idea of what researching this would be like
